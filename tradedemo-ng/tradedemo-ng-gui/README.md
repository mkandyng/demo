This project is the Web frontend of a skeleton trading application I am intending to develop to serve as a blueprint on how to apply modern technologies to implement a working cloud-native application that adheres to the principles of < href="https://12factor.net/">12 Factor App</a> and <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a>.

A <a href="http://http://tradedemo-ng.appspot.com" alt="tradedemo-ng">live demo</a> is available which is deployed to Google Cloud Platform. 

Note, I have been a Java backend developer in the last decade and only reacquaint my Javascript skills since April 2019. This project is a learning exercise so my focus is to quickly familiar myself with ReactJS and its technology ecosystem. 

As a software engineer and not a UI designer, I am done with the GUI and its functionalities. I am happy enough to share my code as it because I know it is clean. However I need to spend another week to really understand modern JS and React 'Best Practices' to refactor the codebase with unit and integration tests before I really call it done with any professional pride.
